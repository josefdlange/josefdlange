### Greetings! ðŸ––

My name's Joey. I'm a ten-year veteran Software Engineer with experience working at large global companies and absolutely tiny startups alike. I am creative, hard-working, diversely talented and interested, and a quick study. As of August 2023 (the time of this writing), I'm **currently looking for work**, and would be delighted to talk about opportunities you have available, and how we might be a good fit. I am highly motivated to work with companies who aim to improve peoples' lives in a direct way by means of delivering products of compassion.

I live in beautiful Southeast Wisconsin, where along with my partner Nikki, I tend to a small pack of dogs, cats, chickens, honeybees, and a small garden of native plants and very hot peppers. I love to spend my free time outdoors, most often golfing, or indoors, tinkering with my gadgets or baking sourdough bread from my starter, Lacto B. Silverstein (Attorney-at-Loaf).

Send me an email! Toot at me on Mastodon. I'm looking forward to meeting you.
